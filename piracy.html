<h1 style="color:orange;">How to Pay for Games, Legallyâ„¢</h1>
<p style="color:pink;">Hello everybody! Ignore what I said before about pirating games, I've learned from my mistakes!</p>
<p style="color:pink;">After all, companies worth billions of dollars deserve our money!</p>
<p style="color:pink;">And they are so affordable nowadays. $100 for a game with hundreds of seconds of fun?</p>
<p style="color:pink;">We shouldn't use websites like FitGirl Repacks, SteamRIP, Xatab, ElAmigos, DODI, since they don't provide ONLINE-FIX for multiplayer games. </p>
